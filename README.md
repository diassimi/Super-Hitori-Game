# Super-Hitori-Game


The game presents a playing board with 64 squares. Each square has a number in it and can be unset, unshaded, or shaded.

When the game starts, even square is unset. Clicking a square once changes it to unshaded, which has a circle in it. Clicking a cell a second time changes it to shaded, which is white on a black background. Clicking the cell again returns it to unset.

The Player can win when:
  No number appears unshaded in a row or column more than once.
  Shaded (black) squares do not touch each other vertically or horizontally.
  When completed, all un-shaded (white) squares create a single continuous area.
